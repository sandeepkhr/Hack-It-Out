## Idea
### Overview :
Hello and welcome to our idea on innovative diabetes detecting website “Diabeteasy”. Our website aims to allow the user to detect their diabetic status by allowing people to easily test themselves from the comfort of their own homes, and providing them with information and resources to manage their diabetes effectively.

### Website Utilization Process : 
Our website takes various inputs from the user, which are the key factors that affect diabetes, and runs them through our Machine Learning algorithm to determine the person's diabetes status. These inputs include age, BMI ,blood pressure,glucose level, etc. By utilizing these inputs, our algorithm can provide an accurate diagnosis and help people understand their diabetes status.

### Personalized Treatment Recommendations(If tested Positive)  :
Our website will provide some of the best scientifically proven practices that the person can practice at home, such as diet plans, exercise regimes, and monitoring blood sugar levels. This will empower the user to take control of their diabetes and live a healthier life and also enable the user to get the best possible care, and manage their diabetes in the most effective way.

### Track their medications :
Users can track their daily medication use through the website. The website will allow the user to put the data on the website for all the medicines they are taking as inputs.From our side, we will recommend some activities that we have mentioned above. The website will simply remind them whether they have practiced the recommended activities or not(just like checklisting items we have completed). In this way, the user can find a pattern in their activities(by seeing the activities performed on various days) and can confirm whether they are performing the recommended practices in the right manner or not.

### Conclusion :
In conclusion, our diabetes detecting website is a game-changer in the world of diabetes detection and management. We believe that it has the potential to save countless lives, and we hope to make a positive impact in the fight against diabetes. Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to presenting our idea at the hackathon.
